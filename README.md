# Flasher
Windows script to facilitate flashing an ESP8266/NodeMCU without installing a full IDE.


## Introduction
For novice users, flashing a firmware into an ESP8266/NodeMCU board is 
quite a hurdle. Either they have to download and install the Arduino IDE 
with ESP8266 plugin as described on the
[Arduino web](http://www.arduinesp.com/getting-started).
Or they have to learn the command line interface of the 
[esptool](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases).

This project delivers a Windows batch script (`flash.cmd`) that should 
deliver a "one-click" flash experience. It relies on the 
[esptool](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck) 
from Christian Klippel and Ivan Grokhotkov to do the actual flashing.


## Concepts
The `flash.cmd` script executes these steps
 - Find flash tool
 - Find firmware image
 - Find COM port of a connected ESP8266
 - Execute flashing

 
### Find flash tool
By default the `flash.cmd` script looks for `esptool.exe` in the same 
directory as the script itself. 

If the tool is not present in that directory it checks if Arduino with 
ESP8266 has been installed, and tries to pick up `esptool.exe` there.

So, if your PC has Arduino with ESP8266, there is no need to download 
a copy of the esptool.

As of 2020, I have added the [esptool binary](https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases/download/0.4.13/esptool-0.4.13-win32.zip) 
to this project, to make it even more "one-click".


### Find firmware image
By default the `flash.cmd` script looks for a binary firmware file 
(a file ending in `*.bin`) in the same directory as the script itself. 

If a firmware file is not present in that directory the script checks if 
there is an Arduino build-cache, and tries to pick up a firmware file there. 

Note that Arduino clears its build cache upon exit.


### Find COM port of a connected ESP8266
The `flash.cmd` script enumerates all known COM ports. If only one is found
it is selected automatically. Otherwise a dialog pops up for the user to 
enter the COM port of choice.


### Execute flashing
Just before executing the actual flash command, the `flash.cmd` script 
pops up a dialog with a summary of its findings. The user clicks Ok to flash
or Cancel to abort.

After pressing Ok, the `flash.cmd` script starts the esptool, which takes 
tens of seconds to complete. 

Note that while the `flash.cmd` script is running it prints all its findings
to a windows console. It saves a copy to a the file `flash.log` in the same 
directory as the script.


## Example
Create a directory (e.g. `flash` on the desktop) with the following content

```
flash.cmd
esptool.exe
mRPM.ino_v4.bin
```

The file `flash.cmd` and `esptool.exe` are delivered by this project. 
The `bin` file is some binary that needs to be flashed.

A double click on `flash.cmd` generates the following log file of its actions.
